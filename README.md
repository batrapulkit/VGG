# VGG Transformer Model
This repository demonstrates how to integrate the VGG model (a well-known Convolutional Neural Network) with a Transformer architecture for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, or any other vision-language task. The model first extracts features using VGG, and then passes those features to a Transformer model for sequence modeling.

# Features
VGG as Feature Extractor: Uses the VGG architecture to extract deep features from images.
Transformer for Sequence Modeling: Uses a Transformer-based model to process the extracted features.
Pretrained Models: Leverages pretrained VGG models for feature extraction and a Transformer for sequence generation tasks.
Flexible Architecture: Can be adapted for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, or other vision-language tasks.
